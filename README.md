This is a quick hack to transform a bot database into JSON.

The channel `#emacs` on Freenode has a resident bot, called `fsbot`,
with a very old and grown database of little factoids. The database is
[available online](http://gnufans.net/~fsbot/data/), but only in the
Emacs-specific bbdb format.

This repository has a script to convert the database to JSON, and an
example output.
