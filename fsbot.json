      "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. (Mahatma Gandhi)",
      "There I discovered something about capitalists. They are all alike, whatever the nationality. All they wanted from me was the most work for the least money that kept me alive. So I became a Communist. (Nikita Khrushchev)",

      "\"From its very inception, Anarchism and its greatest teachers have maintained that it is not the abuse of power which corrupts everybody, the best more often than the worst men, but that it is the thing itself, namely /power/, which is evil and takes the very spirit and revolutionary fighting strength out of everybody who wields power.\" (Emma Goldman, letter to Eusebio Carbó, 1936-05-01)",
      "\"The primary concern of every government is to ensure its continuance in power irrespective of the men who form it. If they are bad, they want to remain in power in order to enrich themselves and to satisfy their lust for authority; and if they are honest and sincere they believe that it is their duty to remain in power for the benefit of the people\" (Malatesta)",
      "\"But this minority [the people's government], the Marxists argue, would consist of workers.

      "\"When we say that power corrupts those who wield it, we do not mean that such people necessarily fall victims to the temptations of bribery and material gain as is, for instance, the case in American poltical life. What we do firmly believe is that no one can resist the effect that power has in modifying thought and human personality.\" (V. Richards, Lessons of the Spanish Revolution, p.68)",
      "\"And only few strong personalities can, once they have basked in it, dispense with the limelight that accompanies power.\" (V. Richards, Lessons of the Spanish Revolution, p.68)",
      "\"[The comrades] should above all remember that the exaltation of a man is politically a dangerous thing and morally unhealthy as much for him who is exalted as for those who do the exalting.\" (Malatesta, quoted by Vernon Richards. Lessons of the Spanish Revolution, p146)",
      "[Anarchism] is based on analogies derived from the simplicity and harmony of universal physical laws, rather than on any assumptions of the natural goodness of human nature-and this is precisely where it begins to diverge fundamentally from democratic socialism,which goes back to Rousseau, the true founder of state socialism.

      "Anyone who makes plans for after the revolution is a reactionary. (Mikhail Bakunin)",
      "By striving to do the impossible, man has always achieved what is possible. Those who have cautiously done no more than they believed possible have never taken a single step forward. (Mikhail Bakunin)",

      "Reality has a well-known liberal bias. (Stephen Colbert)",

      "The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question.",
      "The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.",
      "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.",
      "These relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society -- the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness.",
      "The mode of production of material life determines the social, political and intellectual life process in general.",
      "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.",
      "labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his intrinsic nature; herefore he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and his mind.",
      "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.",
      "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.",
      "But to the extent that labour power circulates in the market, it is not capital, no form of commodity-capital. The labourer is not a capitalist, although he brings a commodity to market, namely his own skin.",
      "The first premise of all human history is the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.",
      "In the social production of life, we enter into relations that are indispensable and independent of will; these relations correspond to a stage of development of their material forces of production.",
      "The essence of the modern state is the union of the universal with the full freedom of the particular, and with the welfare of individuals.",
      "What experience and history teach is that nations and governments have never learned anything from history, or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it.",
      "The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom.",
      "We may affirm absolutely that nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion.",
      "The science of religion is one science within philosophy; indeed it is the final one. In that respect it presupposes the other philosophical disciplines and is therefore a result.",
      "The beginning of religion, more precisely its content, is the concept of religion itself, that God is the absolute truth, the truth of all things, and subjectively that religion alone is the absolutely true knoweldge.",
      "I am convinced that the unwritten knowledge scattered among men of different callings surpasses in quantity and in importance anything we find in books, and that the greater part of our wealth has yet to be recorded.",
      "Although the whole of this life were said to be nothing but a dream and the physical world nothing but a phantasm, I should call this dream or phantasm real enough, if, using reason well, we were never deceived by it.",
      "There are two kinds of truths: those of reasoning and those of fact. The truths of reasoning are necessary and their opposite is impossible; the truths of fact are contingent and their opposites are possible.",
      "There will always be some people who think for themselves, even among the self-appointed guardians of the great mass who, after having thrown off the yoke of immaturity themselves, will spread about them the spirit of a reasonable estimate of their own value and of the need for every man to think for himself.",
      "The history of mankind can be seen, in the large, as the realization of Natureâs secret plan to bring forth a perfectly constituted state as the only condition in which the capacities of mankind can be fully developed, and also bring forth that external relation among states which is perfectly adequate to this end.",
      "Human reason has this peculiar fate that in one species of its knowledge it is burdened by questions which, as prescribed by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to ignore, but which, as transcending all its powers, it is also not able to answer.",
      "The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living."
